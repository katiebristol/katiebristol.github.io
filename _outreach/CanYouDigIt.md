[Can You Dig It?](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/event/can-you-dig-it/) is a family-friendly event where participants get to dig into the wonders of geology and discover the Earth beneath their feet through hands-on activities offered both inside and outside the Museum. Visitors can watch exciting demonstrations of volcanic eruptions and explore exhibits featuring fossils, gems, minerals, and rocks from Florida and around the world. 

During the years I participated, this event garnered the attendance of 1500-2000 children and community members annually.

Some of the activities can be seen below:

Make Your Own Compass
======
In this activity, students created their own compasses by magnetizing paperclips and floating them on small toy boats. By observing how the magnetized paperclip aligned with Earth’s magnetic field, they explored the basic principles of magnetism and navigation. Students then used their homemade compasses to “navigate” across a water tray, connecting hands-on experimentation with real-world applications in Earth science and exploration.

Rock or Choc?
======
In this interactive activity, kids tested a variety of samples using a small magnetic susceptibility meter to determine whether they were rocks or chocolate. This hands-on experiment introduced the concept of magnetic properties while challenging participants to guess the material, combining science with a sweet twist.

Magnetism vs. Gravity
======
In this hands-on activity, kids explored the forces of magnetism and gravity by observing paperclips "levitating" beneath hanging magnets. With the paperclips tethered to the table, participants saw how magnetic force can counteract gravity, sparking fun conversations about invisible forces and how they shape our world.

Drilling Demo
======
In this activity, students had the unique opportunity to use a paleomagnetic drill to collect rock cores from limestone. Guided by experienced paleomagnetists, they learned about the process of collecting samples in the field and were educated on the importance of safety and proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), including hard hats, safety glasses, and hearing protection, to ensure a safe and effective learning experience.

Trashcan Volcano
======
In this demonstration, students witnessed a “trashcan volcano” eruption -- a classic experiment that simulates volcanic explosions using a plastic trashcan, liquid nitrogen, and water. As pressure rapidly built up and released in a dramatic burst, participants learned about the physics behind explosive volcanic eruptions and sparked curiosity about volcanic processes.
