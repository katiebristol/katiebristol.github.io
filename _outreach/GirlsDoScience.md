To celebrate International Women and Girls in Science Day this free, family-friendly program features hands-on activities, engaging experiments, and opportunities to connect with scientists from a variety of fields. 

Explore science at home with the [Girls Do Science FREE activity book](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2021/01/2020-NEA-BigRead-Girls-Do-Science-Activity-Book-lowres.pdf), featuring fun, hands-on projects for all ages—plus dedicated sections for Elementary, Middle, and High School students. Each activity was created by a scientist and includes background info, materials, easy-to-follow instructions, and extra resources to keep the discovery going.

Rocks and Minerals
======
Kids explored a hands-on collection of colorful minerals, unique rocks, and real fossils while chatting with geoscientists about how Earth’s features form and change over time. From sparkling crystals to ancient shells, there was something for every budding geologist to discover.

Rock or Choc?
======
In this interactive activity, kids tested a variety of samples using a small magnetic susceptibility meter to determine whether they were rocks or chocolate. This hands-on experiment introduced the concept of magnetic properties while challenging participants to guess the material, combining science with a sweet twist.

Picture Yourself as a Scientist
======
This interactive booth introduced kids to the tools real geoscientists use -- from rock hammers and compasses to field notebooks and computers. Young explorers got to dress up in safety vests and hard hats, pose with real scientific gear, and snap a photo to imagine themselves as future scientists in the field.
