The [Scientist in Every Florida School](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/earth-systems/scientist-in-every-florida-school/about-sefs/) program connects scientists with K–12 public schools across Florida -- particularly Title I schools -- by offering teachers valuable professional development, classroom resources, and ongoing support. Through a statewide professional learning community, SEFS fosters long-term, collaborative partnerships between educators and scientists. The mission of SEFS is to engage Florida K–12 students and teachers in cutting-edge research by providing science role models and meaningful experiences that inspire the next generation of planetary stewards.

As a Visiting Scientist for Collier County Public Schools, I had the opportunity to engage with over 10 second-grade classrooms both in person and virtually via Zoom. Drawing on my background in geophysics and planetary science, I introduced students to a wide range of topics: from basic concepts in geology and physics to the wonders of planets and outer space. In addition, I collaborated with fellow Visiting Scientists to support K–12 teachers in strengthening STEM curriculum and integrating real-world science into their classrooms.
