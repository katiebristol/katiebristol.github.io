Physics Inside Out is a program on Purdue’s West Lafayette campus, offered each summer to students in current grades 7 and 8.

Based on interactive hands-on lessons and activities, students learn about fundamental principles of physics and their applications.

We designed some planetary science activities:

Magnetic Dipoles
======
In this activity, students made both 2D and 3D representations of a planetary dipole.
