My research uses magnetic records to reconstruct the origins, evolution, and habitability of planetary systems. By studying paleomagnetic and rock magnetic data from extraterrestrial materials, Precambrian rocks, and modern geological formations, I investigate how magnetic fields shape planetary bodies from the early solar system to the present day. This research enhances our understanding of planetary formation, Earth’s magnetic evolution, and the conditions that support habitable environments across time and space.

    title: "Solar Nebula Magnetism and the Origins of Planetary Systems"
    excerpt: "I study magnetic records preserved in extraterrestrial materials, such as meteorites and asteroid samples to understand the magnetic environment of the early solar system. These samples offer a rare opportunity to investigate the role of magnetic fields in the evolution of the protoplanetary disk, planetesimal formation, and early planetary dynamics. This research helps constrain theoretical models of solar system evolution and provides comparative insight into the formation of exoplanetary systems."

    excerpt: "The Precambrian, which makes up nearly 90% of Earth’s history, includes major events such as the initiation of plate tectonics, the formation of the inner core, and the rise of atmospheric oxygen and life. Despite its importance, paleointensity data from this era are extremely limited. I work to address this gap by recovering high-quality paleointensity records from Precambrian rocks, enabling us to probe the long-term evolution of Earth’s magnetic field and its implications for the thermal, geodynamic, and habitability history of the planet."

    title: "Multi-Scale Magnetic Approaches to Geologic Questions"
    excerpt: "Beyond the early solar system and Precambrian, I use rock magnetic and paleomagnetic tools to tackle a wide range of geoscientific problems. I apply these methods to characterize mineralogy and alteration histories, date geologic events, reconstruct past environmental conditions, and provide constraints on the rates of volcanic, sedimentary, and tectonic processes."
