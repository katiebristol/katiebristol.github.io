To celebrate International Women and Girls in Science Day this free, family-friendly program features hands-on activities, engaging experiments, and opportunities to connect with scientists from a variety of fields. 

Rocks and Minerals
======
Kids explored a hands-on collection of colorful minerals, unique rocks, and real fossils while chatting with geoscientists about how Earthâ€™s features form and change over time. From sparkling crystals to ancient shells, there was something for every budding geologist to discover.

Picture Yourself as a Scientist
======
This interactive booth introduced kids to the tools real geoscientists use -- from rock hammers and compasses to field notebooks and computers. Young explorers got to dress up in safety vests and hard hats, pose with real scientific gear, and snap a photo to imagine themselves as future scientists in the field.
