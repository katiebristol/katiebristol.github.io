<p>I grew up in Michigan and attended Michigan Technological University where I received a BS
    in Applied Geophysics/Geological Engineering (2018) and a MS in Geophysics (2020). Here are some photos 
    from fieldwork involving the Midcontinent Rift System, backpacking Isle Royale National Park, and hiking
    in other gorgeous areas of the state.</p>
