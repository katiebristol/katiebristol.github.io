<p>As part of my undergraduate field training, I attended <a href="https://frontiersabroad.com/">Frontiers Abroad</a>.
The five-week field camp through the University of Canterbury consisted of a series of interlinked modules that 
explore the stratigraphy, mountain building, and tectonics of the South Island, and the volcanology and geothermal 
geology of the North Island. If you are interested in doing field camp abroad, I highly recommend FA.</p> 

<p>This field course was insanely fun for me as I got to see everything from active volcanoes to 
  glaciers and metamorphic core complexes. Attending FA was also my first time ever flying and my first time seeing the ocean (I
  actually saw both the Pacific and the Atlantic ocean in the same day as I had layovers in both NYC and LA...).</p>
